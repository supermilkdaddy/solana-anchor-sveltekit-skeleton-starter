# solana-anchor-sveltekit-skeleton-starter

### Please note that this is actively updated and likely to change.

This is a simple starter template that tries to keep up with the latest updates and releases from Solana, Anchor, SvelteKit, and Skeleton. It has a sample program utilizing PDAs and leverages the walletStore and workspaceStore to interact with the on-chain program. The `/pdas` routes also demonstrates how to use SvelteKit's `PageLoad` from within `+page.ts` and the `PageData` inside the `+page.svelte` component. 

You must first install all the necessary tools and packages required to run Solana and SvelteKit apps. Please reference their documentation for more details.
